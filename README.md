# WhatToCode

## WhatToCode is meant to be a small website where you get a random project with little tasks to complete in order to learn or master your skills.

### I will need your feedback to decide if this is worth the effort of not.

It's just a simple idea , it will become more complete after a while. This is what I've have already done and what is planned for the future:

- [x] Display projects titles and different tasks
- [X] Author system
- [X] Vote system
- [ ] Coding language filter
- [ ] Approximate project time
- [ ] Project difficulty
- [ ] Group projects
- [ ] Comments feedback on each project card
- [ ] Create accounts and get achievements for doing certain things
- [ ] Level system

I would really appreciate your feedback ! And if there's not enough info I could explain it a bit more.
Also, if someone if interested in helping me code it , just get in touch with me ! :)
